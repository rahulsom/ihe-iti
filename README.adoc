== A better description

IHE has a bunch of profiles as part of the IT Infrastructure (ITI) Framework.
Like anything related to healthcare, it comes with its own quirks.
Also given that these profiles use SOAP Web Services and use MTOM and JAXB doesn't like a lot of things that are being done here, any developer is likely to have a tough time dealing with these profiles.

This project aims to make it easier for anyone who wants to work with these profiles.

Currently this supports these services:

* PIX, PDQ, XCPD
* XDS.b (Repository/Registry), XCA (Initiating/Responding)
* SVS Repository
* RAD

In Addition, it supports parsing of CDA Documents.
Look at `com.github.rahulsom.cda.POCDMT000040ClinicalDocument`
